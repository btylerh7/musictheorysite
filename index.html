  <h1> Oh, Hello There!</h1>
  <p>I am happy that you decided to come visit my website! Here, you will learn
    everything you need to know about music theory and how to read and write it.
    I also would like you to think about the following question: What <strong>
      is </strong> music? You really do not need to think about it too much, but
       I just want you to. Please look at the following sections for more help!
       Let's get started!</p>
    <h1>What is Music Theory?</h1>
    <p>Music theory is not rocket science, by any means. However, it is difficult
      for people who are just starting out to master. Have no fear, though! I
      am here to fix that for you. In the following paragraphs, I will introduce
      you to music theory!</p>
    <p>Think of music theory as the "language of music." Learning music theory
      is a lot like learning a language: you have to start with the basics and
      then expand. In lanugage, you have words. Words make sentences. In music,
      these words are called notes. Notes are essentially just sounds. </p>
      <h1>Test Video Time!</h1>
      <p> The following is a test of the iframe embed method:</p>
      <p id="demo"></p>
    <button type="button"
    onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">Click me please,
     bro!</button>
     <p></p>
     <p id="myDates"></p>
     <script type="text/javascript">
     var myDate = new Date (),
     month = myDate.getMonth(),
     day = myDate.getDate(),
     year = myDate.getFullYear();

     var months = [ "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December" ];
document.getElementById("myDates").innerHTML = months[month] + " " + day + ", " + year;
     </script>
   </div>
</body>
